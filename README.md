Max Reason's XBasic for Linux - Basic programming language and interactive development environment
This package works in the same way on both Linux and Windows, so that code from one operating system will run on the other.
It is an excellent version of Basic with many graphics and interactive program display development features.
Available here is the release. When changes become necessary the code will be added to this repository.
